        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Daniel Alwin, currently pursuing my Diploma in Computer Science at UiTM (Universiti Teknologi MARA), Campus 2, Samarahan, Malaysia. I have a passion for coding and am continuously honing my skills in various programming languages and web technologies.
        </p>
        <h3>My Education</h3>
        <p> 
            At UiTM, I am delving into the world of computer science, where I'm gaining a solid foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical applications. I am particularly fascinated by the versatility and power of programming languages, and I'm actively learning C++, Python, Java, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. 
        </p>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I consider myself to be a tinkerer in the world of computer science. Learning new concepts keep my passion for computer science alive. Just the idea of experiencing something new excites me and keeps me going.</p>
        <p>I find fascination in many sub-fields of computer science, but artificial intelligence and machine learning has captured my interests a lot more recently.</p>
